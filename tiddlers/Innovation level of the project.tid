title: Innovation level of the project

Today, waste management in Ukraine is mostly linked to the traditional methods of disposal and heat treatment (incineration). The concept of waste recycling, as well as the concept of secondary materials in the country is at a very early stage of development. In Ukraine, there are no large plants or enterprises for recycling or recovery, as well as other alternative methods of waste processing (such projects are currently either at the stage of idea, planning or trial implementation). [[Attempts are being made|https://bigkiev.com.ua]] in the capital to deploy a separate collection, with the installation of special containers and the involvement of sorting contractors, but today these attempts are chaotic and punctual and are not particularly successful.
Thus, such a plant will be the first large and the first state-owned enterprise in the country. In the early stages, simplified technologies will be used to minimize the necessary funds, but in later stages it is possible to introduce modern technologies for maximum efficiency and productivity of the plant (as well as make it fully automated).
At the stage of deployment of the information campaign it is envisaged to use all the most modern methods of influencing and conveying information to communities.
