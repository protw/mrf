According to the [[State Administration of Statistics in Kyiv|http://kiev.ukrstat.gov.ua/p.php3?c=3488&lang=1]], the capital's waste generation is abrupt, flashing with, nevertheless, positive overall dynamics of increasing. As to the methods of treatment, most of the waste (especially low-hazard household waste) is being sent to landfills, or less often - to incineration for energy acquisition or thermal processing.

Today, the EU sees traditional landfilling methods as obsolete, inefficient and unprofitable (economically, logistically and environmentally), and recognizes their use mainly for the disposal of only those types of waste that cannot be disposed of or recycled in other ways, as provided by European legislation. At the same time, for Ukraine, in connection with the chosen vector of development and political cooperation, as well as in accordance with the Agreement on European Integration ([[Section V, Chapter 6|https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/984_011#n2277]]), there is a need to revise its own legislation and approaches to economic and social activity, including waste management.

Despite the active [[repair|https://uprom.info/news/other/ekologiya/kiyivskiy-smittyespalyuvalniy-zavod-zakrivayut-na-remont/]] and [[modernization|https://uprom.info/news/other/ekologiya/kyyivskij-smittyespalyuvalnyj-zavod-zmenshyt-kilkist-vykydiv-u-5-raziv/]] works carried out at the Kyiv waste incineration plant "Energy" since 2018, as well as plans for future expansion, this company has no sufficient capacity to cover the volume of waste production in the capital. Moreover, the operation of the plant is still of grave concern to residents of the city, in particular, of Darnytskyi district. It is not difficult to predict the aggravation of this problem in the case of expansion and consequent increase in the flow of solid waste for disposal by this enterprise.

Finally, the events of 2016-2017 related to the tragedy at the Lviv landfill and its consequences, which spread at the national level, are still "fresh" in the country's memory. Obviously, no one wants these situations to happen again, and the authorities have taken precautionary measures. But, given the age, condition and quality of our landfills, as well as the trend of maximizing the period of their use - their strengthening only postpones, but does not solve the problem completely, and cities are not insured against potential new man-made disasters.
